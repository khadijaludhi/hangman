# Hangman Game

A classic game of Hangman made with Python.

## What I Learned
- **Python Basics**: Through this project, I deepened my understanding of Python's fundamentals, such as loops, conditionals, and data structures like lists and sets.
- **File Organization**: I learned how to structure a Python project with multiple files for better organization and readability.
- **String Manipulation**: This project provided hands-on experience with string methods, formatting, and manipulations.
- **User Interaction**: This project has user input at its core, teaching the basics of input validation and user interaction.
- **Visual Representation**: Introduced the concept of visual representation in the terminal using multi-line strings for the hangman stages.

## Features
- Random Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word for the player to guess.
- Visual Feedback: Provides visual feedback of the hangman as the player loses lives.
- Input Validation: Ensures the player's input is a valid letter and checks if the letter has been guessed before.
- Informative UI: Informs the player of their remaining lives, the word's current state, and letters they have already guessed.

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd hangman`

## Usage
